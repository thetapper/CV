Personal Statement

Computer Science is shaping the world that we are all living in, and I want to be a part of that. I want to help create a world that is helpful and beneficial to all that live in it. That is why I try to  broaden my view of life by being as involved in as many activities as I can. I personally believe that the world we have is a beautiful place and technology should not take that beauty away from humanity. So I want to help make technology that is only beneficial and valuable to humanity and not controlling and detrimental.
